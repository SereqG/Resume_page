# ResuME

ResuME is my personal project that was created for educational purposes and to develop my skills in working with frontend tools. The web application allows users to generate a resume based on a selected template and entered data.

## Features

The project was created to improve skills in working with the JavaScript framework Next.js and related technologies. In the process of developing the application, I utilized advanced capabilities provided by the applied technologies. Many months of work resulted in the creation of a useful web application that enables the creation of aesthetically pleasing resumes.

- The homepage welcomes the user and enticingly showcases the application's features. This page has been designed to encourage the user to further explore the application. From here, users can navigate to the main part of the application - the resume generator.

- Template selection: Upon entering the generator, users can choose from one of three available templates, all designed to provide users with diversity.

- Data completion: At this stage, we fill in the details of our CV, with several available sections to choose from.

- Personalization: For visual customization of the CV, users can modify the appearance of the file to tailor it to their preferences.

- File download: After completing all the previous steps, users can freely download the result of their work to their computer and enjoy their CV.


## Problems that I am aware of.
